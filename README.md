Welcome to my digital space! I'm Nilay Arangil, a coding enthusiast who loves to dive into the worlds of Python and C#. On this website, I share my passion through engaging courses, connecting with learners worldwide, and showcasing projects that bring code to life with Raspberry Pi.

Beyond the screen, my love for music shines through. As a pianist and violinist, I enjoyed being part of the varsity group during my middle school years. The harmonious notes add a unique touch to my journey.

Sports have played a significant role in my life, particularly tennis. The UTR tournament trophies and the pride of leading my middle school team to the 2020 district championships are moments I cherish.

Chess and number sense are not just hobbies; they are avenues for me to share knowledge. Winning the first prize for number sense in high school was a rewarding experience.

Join me on this journey of coding, music, sports, and intellectual exploration. Explore the various facets of my life through this digital lens, and let's embark on a shared adventure of learning and creativity!
