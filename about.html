                     <p>I am Nilay Arangil, currently a freshman at Shadow Creek High School in Pearland, Texas. My interests encompass programming, coaching, volunteering, and playing tennis. Presently, I offer coaching sessions in number sense, Python, C#, Raspberry Pi, and general web development. In 2022, I initiated my website, houstonmentors.com, where I share details about upcoming courses. My coaching experience extends from guiding students as young as 8 years old to supporting engineering graduates.</p>
                     <p>While coding and coaching play a significant role in my life, I equally value other pursuits. Representing my school in singles tennis, I contributed to our district championship win in 2022. Victories in several UTR tournaments have fueled my determination to achieve new heights in the sport. Additionally, I contribute to Firstraquet, a volunteer organization aiding underprivileged young athletes in Angola. On weekends, I lend a helping hand to non-profit organizations like Houston Food Bank, Guruvayur Temple, and Namadwar, participating in packing and distributing food and resources to those in need throughout the Houston community.</p>
                     <p>Music holds a special place in my heart, with the piano and violin as my instruments of choice. As a part of the middle school orchestra, I enjoyed playing for the varsity team. During my free time, I express myself through sketching and painting.</p>
                     <p>Stay tuned for updates on upcoming courses, projects, and volunteering initiatives. Let's explore the exciting possibilities that technology, coaching, and community hold together!</p>
                     <p>Cheers!</p>
