          <p>
            For over two years, I’ve been a dedicated volunteer stringer for FirstRacquet.org, even receiving a special thank you on their website 
            (<a href="https://firstracquet.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thanks Note</a>).
            Stringing racquets ensures players have access to top-notch equipment, maximizing their performance. This not only saves FirstRacquet
            valuable time and resources, but also strengthens our community.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s incredibly rewarding to connect with passionate players, dedicated coaches, and fellow volunteers, all united by a love for the sport.
            Together, we create a supportive and inspiring environment where young tennis players can truly thrive.
